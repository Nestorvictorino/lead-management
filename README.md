ðŸ§  Design and Architecture
Technologies Used
Next.js 14 (App Router)

React 19

Redux Toolkit for global state management

Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive styling

Axios for API requests

****Project Structure****
  ```bash
    /app              # Next.js App Router pages and routes
    /components       # Reusable components (Dropdown, Loader, etc.)
    /store            # Redux slices and store (auth, leads)
    /utils            # Utility functions and helpers
    /public           # Static assets (images, icons)
    /styles           # Global styles including Tailwind CSS
```


****State Management****

Redux Toolkit manages global state with two main slices:

  -authSlice controls user authentication state (isLoggedIn boolean).

Redux is integrated at the root layout (app/layout.tsx) by wrapping the app with the Redux Provider.

Styling

  -Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, making the UI responsive and easy to maintain.

  -Basic Tailwind configuration is in tailwind.config.js.

  -Responsive classes are used to adapt to different screen sizes.

ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

  -The project uses React 19, which might cause compatibility issues with some older libraries.

  -Itâ€™s recommended to use npm install without --force to avoid dependency problems.

  -Authentication is simulated using a boolean isLoggedIn in Redux.

  -Lead data is fetched from API routes under /api (you can configure proxies or base URLs as needed.
